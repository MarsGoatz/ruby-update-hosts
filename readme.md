There are better scripts to update hosts file and I would strongly recommend to use them instead of this but if you really want to use ruby to update hosts file, feel free to use this repo.

- [Steven Black Python Hosts Scripts](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts)
- [Mitchell Krogza Ultiamte Hosts Scripts](https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/Ultimate.Hosts.Blacklist)

In favor of the above two amazing scripts, I development of this repo will be slow and not that active.

To run the script
- Go to main folder
- run **ruby MainRunner.rb**
